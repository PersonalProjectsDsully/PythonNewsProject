# PythonNewsProject
Just a project I am working on to keep in touch with tech news and progressing my programming skills.
To get it working you should be able to insert your own botcode and chatid for telegram in the beautiful.py file and changing the x==0 in the main function, running the databasetest2.py program and then changing the x value back to one and starting it again, this will create the new table and insert the articles from zdnet into it, along with sending yourself the links summary and titles of the new articles to your telegram.
