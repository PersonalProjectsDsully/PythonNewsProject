# PythonNewsProject
Just a project I am working on to keep in touch with tech news and progressing my programming skills.
To get it working you should be able to insert your own bot code and chatid for telegram in the beautiful.py file and changing the x==0 in the main function, running the databasetest2.py program and then changing the x value back to one and starting it again, this will create the new table and insert the articles from ZDNet into it, along with sending yourself the links summary and titles of the new articles to your telegram.

I will be updating this project when I get more information security RSS feeds implemented along with once I get better with sqlite3 making it so you don't have to do the x==0, and then x==1.

There is also a file for just checking the status of a few hundred websites that I am currently combing through and adding more to the list on my machine looking at the validity of the news and I will be categorizing how important each website is. For example this will include https://krebsonsecurity.com/ being very important because of how well the write ups are done and the main subject of the website being more cyber security focused.
